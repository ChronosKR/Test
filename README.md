## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**:
   ```bash
   cd reverse-api-tool
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:12000
   ```

## üìñ How to Use

### 1. Single Request Analysis
- Enter an API URL (e.g., `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`)
- Select HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Add headers if needed (JSON format or Key:Value pairs)
- Add request body for POST/PUT requests
- Click "Analyze API" to get detailed results

### 2. Batch Analysis
- Switch to the "Batch Analysis" tab
- Enter multiple endpoints in JSON format:
  ```json
  [
    {"url": "https://api.example.com/users", "method": "GET"},
    {"url": "https://api.example.com/posts", "method": "GET"},
    {"url": "https://api.example.com/auth", "method": "POST"}
  ]
  ```
- Run batch analysis to test all endpoints

### 3. Endpoint Discovery
- Enter a base URL (e.g., `https://api.example.com`)
- The tool will test common API paths like `/api`, `/v1`, `/users`, etc.
- Discover hidden or undocumented endpoints

### 4. View Captured Requests
- All analyzed requests are automatically captured
- View history of all API calls
- Export data for further analysis

### 5. Generate Documentation
- Automatically generate API documentation from captured requests
- Export documentation as JSON
- Perfect for understanding API structure

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Ethics

### Educational Purpose
This tool is designed for educational purposes and ethical API analysis:
- Only analyze APIs you own or have permission to test
- Respect rate limits and terms of service
- Use for learning, not for malicious purposes
- Follow responsible disclosure for any vulnerabilities found

### Built-in Safeguards
- Reasonable request timeouts
- No automated vulnerability exploitation
- Focus on analysis, not attack
- Educational warnings and guidelines

## üìä Example Outputs

### Security Analysis
```
‚úÖ HTTPS: Enabled
